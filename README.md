# The Gas Programming Language

This programming language allows to script any program that involves Java code.

```lua
println("Hello world!", "This is Gaslang!")
```

This was created by me just for fun and experience and has no purpose.

# Simple Console Calculator
```lua
let inputScanner = InputScanner()
let x, y = inputScanner.nextNumber(), inputScanner.nextNumber()
println(x + y)
```
